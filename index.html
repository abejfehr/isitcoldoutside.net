    Is It Cold Outside.net
    ======================

    This website is designed to give an actual answer to the questions "Is it
    cold outside?"

    In the future, it will hopefully implement machine learning to keep track of
    historical weather, location data, and whether or not people think it's
    warm or not on particular days.

    Using this data, it could construct an idea of whether or not the current
    temperature is warm or not for your area, and time of year.

    The Problem
    ===========

    This is important in a case where two users don't agree that a certain
    temperature is either hot or cold depending on their location or time of
    year. During the summer in Dubai if it were to become 15 degrees Celsius,
    they would be cold, although the same temperature would be warm in parts of
    Scandanavia.

    -5 degrees Celsius may be cold for Canadians during the summer, but in the
    winter a -5 degree day is fantastic.

    Those cases all need to be accounted for, and this website aims to
    accomplish that.

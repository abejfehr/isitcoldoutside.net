# [Is it cold outside?](http://isitcoldoutside.net)

## Goal

This project aims to provide a reasonable answer to the age-old question "is it cold outside?"

## Challenges

Siri has the ability to tell you whether or not it's cold outside but, as far as I can tell, she currently does this by assessing whether or not the temperature is below 5 degrees Celsius.

This has issues, because 15 degrees is chilly in Dubai, whereas at certain times of the year, -5 degrees is nice out here in Canada.

I propose *machine learning* to solve this issue. Using Siri's algorithm I can display the answer, and expect a response from a visitor. Recording past data about users' responses for whether or not it's cold outside at certain times of the year in certain places, I can make a pretty good guess as to whether or not you'd really think it's cold outside.

## It doesn't work...

It's okay, the website is temporarily only using Siri's algorithm to determine whether or not it's cold outside, so the results won't be good. This is only until I can find a database to put weather history into.
